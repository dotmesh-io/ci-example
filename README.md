# CI Examples
dotmesh provides the perfect solution for instantiating data stores in CI nearly instantaneously, providing all of the variants on ready data you need to run tests. When your tests fail, you can capture the states of your data stores, ensuring a far easier experience determining _why_ and _how_ CI failed than logs and configuration alone would give you. It also can help with your compliance and audit trail, catching the states of your application during CI even when they pass, as is required by many compliance regulations.

This repository provides examples with real sample code for using dotmesh in CI pipelines. The tutorials themselves are available at:

* [Travis](https://docs.dotmesh.com/tutorials/capture-failed-ci-runs-travis/)
